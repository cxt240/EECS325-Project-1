Port used: port 5036
Instructions for proxy:
standard input that you specified in the project instructions should suffice. I did attempt a proxy_cache, which didn't exactly work (ran out of time with other things to do), to try that, go to line 39 in proxyd.java and uncomment it (probably should comment out line 38 though).
I used chrome on both the cache and non-cache versions
